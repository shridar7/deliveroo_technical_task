Cron expression parser

This is a Ruby application which parses a given cron expression string and expands each field to show the times at which it will run.



Pre-requisites:

Ruby 2.3.6
Ideally installed by default in most Macbooks. 

If not installed already, first install RVM[Ruby version manager] from https://rvm.io/rvm/install

and then install Ruby from https://rvm.io/rubies/installing [rvm install 2.3.6]



How to run this application:

Download this repository and go to the lib folder in Terminal. 

Run the following: 

~$ ruby parse_cron_string.rb "*/15 0 1,15 * 1-5 /usr/bin/find"

This would produce the following output:

minute        0 15 30 45 
hour          0
day of month  1 15
month         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
day of week   1 2 3 4 5
command       /usr/bin/find



Additional notes:

This application handles all standard cron strings and commands as referenced here https://crontab.guru/

Non-standard inputs will raise exceptions.
